# How to run project

`npm install && npm start`

# Notes

- Pages in the project designed to be responsive. They should be working well in mobile devices.
- This was my first time using Typescript & Tailwind CSS. I've used Bootstrap before so it wasn't so hard to understand Tailwind. I just want to let you know that this project is a result of 3 days of tutorials.
- I've used Redux before but RTK was also a hard challenge for me.
- I haven't use the react-navigation library for the sake of simplicity.
- I've written unit test in other languages before but I'm kind of inexperienced about React Unit Testing.
